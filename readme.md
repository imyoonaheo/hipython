# Portfolio
I am building consulting-oriented projects through the Samjong KPMG Future Academy, focusing on structured problem definition and data-driven decision support.

Rather than emphasizing tools alone, I focus on translating data and AI capabilities into practical business implications.

# 🎯 Focus Areas

- Structuring ambiguous business issues into clear problem statements
- Applying consulting-style frameworks to industry and process analysis
- Evaluating AI applications based on measurable business impact
- Developing actionable recommendations supported by logical reasoning

# 🚀 Project Experience

## Business Process Improvement & AI Application
- Analyzed existing workflow structures and identified operational pain points
- Defined data-utilization opportunities within current processes
- Compared expected impact vs. implementation risks of AI adoption
- Designed short-term PoC and long-term scalability roadmap

Each project emphasizes:
1. Problem Definition
2. Analytical Approach
3. Key Findings
4. Business Implications

# 🛠 Technical Toolkit

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- MySQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

Tools are used to support structured analysis and decision-making processes.
